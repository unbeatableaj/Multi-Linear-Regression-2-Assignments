# Multi-Linear-Regression-2-Assignments
# Introduction

Multi Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In this project, we will be performing Multi Linear Regression on the ToyotaCorolla.csv dataset to analyze the relationship between a car's price and its various features.

# Data Description

The ToyotaCorolla.csv dataset contains 1436 rows and 37 columns. The columns include various features of the car, such as the age of the car, the mileage, the fuel type, the horsepower, and more. The "Price" column represents the corresponding price of that car.

# Methodology

We will be using Multi Linear Regression to model the relationship between the various features of the car and its price. Multi Linear Regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables. We will first visualize the relationship between the variables using a scatter plot matrix. Then we will fit a linear regression model and check its accuracy using the R-squared value. Finally, we will use the model to make predictions on new data.

# Results

Our analysis showed a positive linear relationship between the various features of the car and its price. The scatter plot matrix showed a clear trend, with the price increasing as some features increased and decreasing as some features increased.

The linear regression model had an R-squared value of 0.8850, indicating a strong correlation between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This means that 88.50% of the variation in price can be explained by the variation in the car's features.

Using the linear regression model, we can make predictions on the price of a car given its features.

# Conclusion

Multi Linear Regression is a powerful tool for modeling the relationship between multiple variables. In this project, we used Multi Linear Regression to model the relationship between a car's various features and its price. Our analysis showed a strong positive linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, with the price increasing as some features increased and decreasing as some features increased.

This model can be used by car dealerships to estimate the price of a car given its features. It can also be used by customers to estimate the value of their car based on its features.
